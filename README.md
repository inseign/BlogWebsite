# BlogWebsite
Very pretty and user friendly blog website written in C Sharp with an SQL Server back end.

I was very interested to begin this blog and put forth a lot of ideas I had at the time. After coding this from start to finish I realised that it was just much more fun to code than to blog. If I had really had wanted to write it would have been much simpler to create a wordpress site hosted on AWS.

If your looking for a blog with these technologies specifically then enjoy.
